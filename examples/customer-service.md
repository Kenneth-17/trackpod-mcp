# Customer Service Workflow Example

This example demonstrates how customer service representatives can use Claude with the Track-POD MCP server to handle customer inquiries efficiently.

## Scenario
A customer calls about their order status and needs assistance with delivery issues.

## Conversation Flow

**User:** "I have a customer on the phone asking about order ORD-2025-0114-078. Can you look it up?"

**Claude:** I'll look up that order for you right away.

*[Uses orders_get_by_number tool]*

**Order ORD-2025-0114-078 Details:**
- **Customer**: Maria Rodriguez
- **Status**: Out for Delivery  
- **Route**: ROUTE-2025-0114-003
- **Driver**: Alex Thompson
- **Estimated Delivery**: Today 2:00-4:00 PM
- **Items**: Office supplies (3 packages)
- **Special Instructions**: Front desk delivery only

The order is currently on route ROUTE-2025-0114-003 and should arrive within the delivery window.

---

**User:** "Great! The customer wants to know the exact current location. Can you track the route?"

**Claude:** I'll get the real-time location for you.

*[Uses routes_get_track_by_code tool]*

üìç **Current Location Update:**
- **Position**: Oak Street & 12th Avenue  
- **Status**: 2 stops completed, 3 remaining
- **Next Stop**: Maria Rodriguez (your customer!)
- **ETA**: Approximately 25 minutes
- **Driver Contact**: Alex Thompson - (555) 0123

You can let the customer know their delivery is the next stop and should arrive around 2:25 PM.

---

**User:** "Perfect! Oh wait, the customer just said they need to reject the delivery because they found damage to one of the packages. How do we handle this?"

**Claude:** I'll help you process the rejection. Let me first get the available rejection reasons.

*[Uses reject_reasons_list tool]*

**Available Rejection Reasons:**
1. Damaged goods
2. Incorrect items  
3. Customer not available
4. Address issues
5. Customer refused delivery

I'll mark this order as rejected with "Damaged goods" as the reason.

*[Uses orders_reject_by_number tool]*

‚úÖ **Order Successfully Rejected:**
- Order ORD-2025-0114-078 marked as rejected
- Reason: Damaged goods  
- Timestamp: January 14, 2025 2:15 PM
- Driver notified automatically

**Next Steps:**
- Driver will be notified to skip this delivery
- Customer service team will receive rejection notification
- Return process will be initiated automatically

Would you like me to check if there are replacement items available?

---

**User:** "Yes, and also create a note about the damage for quality control."

**Claude:** I'll create a new order for replacement and add detailed notes.

*[Uses orders_create tool with damage notes]*

‚úÖ **Replacement Order Created:**
- **New Order**: ORD-2025-0114-078-R (replacement)
- **Priority**: Urgent (next day delivery)
- **Notes**: "Replacement for damaged shipment ORD-2025-0114-078. Customer reported damage to packaging on original delivery attempt."

**Quality Control Alert:**
- Original order flagged for damage investigation
- Supplier notification sent automatically  
- Damage pattern will be tracked for quality metrics

The customer can expect their replacement delivery tomorrow during the same time window (2:00-4:00 PM).

---

**User:** "Excellent! One more thing - can you check if we have any other orders for this customer that might be affected?"

**Claude:** Good thinking! Let me search for other orders from Maria Rodriguez.

*[Searches through order system]*

**Other Active Orders for Maria Rodriguez:**
- **ORD-2025-0108-045**: Delivered successfully (January 8)
- **ORD-2025-0120-134**: Scheduled for January 20 (office furniture)

No other current deliveries are affected. The January 20 order is from a different supplier, so no quality concerns there.

**Customer Service Summary:**
‚úÖ Issue resolved professionally  
‚úÖ Replacement order created with priority  
‚úÖ Quality control notified  
‚úÖ Customer kept informed throughout process  
‚úÖ Driver route updated in real-time

Is there anything else you need for this customer?
